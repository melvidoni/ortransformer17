# OR-Transformer

OR-TRansformer is a tool to create an Object-Relationship database from an UML Class Diagram. The transformation mapping
 was Dr Fernanda Golobisky PhD thesis. I worked on creating the tool during 2011-2012 as part of an undergraduate
 research scholarship, in Universidad Tecnológica Nacional.

 In 2017, I revamped the application using JavaFX during my free time. In 2011, the tool was presented in CNEISI
 (National Conference of Information Systems Engineering Students), where it was awarded with the "Best Student Work"
 prize.
